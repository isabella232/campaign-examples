# Upgrade RxJS using Sourcegraph Campaigns

> NOTE: Sourcegraph Campaigns require the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) be [installed](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#installation) and [configured](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#setup) to point at your [Campaigns enabled](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/campaigns) Sourcegraph instance.

This examples upgrades RxJS in the [codeintellify](https://github.com/sourcegraph/codeintellify) repository to 6.5.4. While Campaigns are designed to run over hundreds of repositories, this example is limited to a single repository for speed, as the intention is to demo the workflow, not how it scales.

To try, run:

1. `make search-scope`
1. `make build` to build the required Docker image
1. `make exec` to run the [action steps](action.json)
1. `make campaign-plan` to take the diffs generated by `make exec` and create a campaign preview

## To try this on a repository of your choosing

To try this your own repositories, change the value of the `scopeQuery` field in [action.json](action.json).
